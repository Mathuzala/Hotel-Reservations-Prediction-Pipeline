# Hotel-Reservations-Prediction-Pipeline
This project leverages the Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a customer will cancel a hotel booking based on a range of features such as lead time, room type, and number of guests aiming to reduce revenue loss due to cancellations and no-shows in online hotel booking channels.
